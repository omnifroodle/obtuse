Verificationism: the meaning of a proposition is the manner in which it is shown to be true. If it cannot be decided how a proposition would be shown to be true, the proposition is meaningless. Many metaphysical theses are consequently meaningless.
Mathematical truths are necessary because they are true by definition. By themselves, they don't tell us anything about the world. Knowledge about the world comes from experience.
