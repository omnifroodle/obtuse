It's never right to hold a belief without evidence or argument.
A government's legitmacy is maintained by the consent of its people. You implicitly consent to your government's social contract by enjoying the benefits of that contract, living in the respective country under that government.
You are entitled to whatever you produce by your physical work, but your right is limited by your ability to use what you produced.
We are at the same time men and women (human animals), immaterial spirits, and bearers of self-consciousness (persons). Only persons have rights. The continuity of a person's memories ensures that one is the same person over time.
Freedom requires (1) the will to act, and (2) the power to succeed in your course of actions.
