If Being is that of which something or other, no matter what, is true, then Unbeing is that of which nothing at all is true.
Equally, being is not just existing (being, period) but being anything whatever: being hot or being cold, being earth or being water, and so on.
Being encompasses everything that exists.
There is a difference between knowledge and belief.
