Marxism, as an empirical theory, has been falsified.
Incitement to intolerance should be illegal and the state should protect the poor from the wealthy.
Plato and Marx were enemies of the open society.
The state must leave enough room for markets to correct themselves. However, unlimited economic freedom is incoherent. Without government intervention, monopolies, trusts and unions will create unfreedom. Freedom requires restrictions.
The difference between science and pseudoscience is falsifiability. There is no such thing as confirmation of a scientific theory, per se. There is only survival of severe testing, when we look for predictive failures from our theories, but the theory does not fail to agree with experimental evidence.
