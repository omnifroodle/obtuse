Reflective equilibrium: general principles ('never kill') may be in conflict with each other ('kill when it prevents mass murder'), or in conflict with beliefs about special cases ('Superman was right to kill Zod'). Upon reflection, we may discover these kinds of conflicts, and try to resolve them by adjusting our general principles (giving up on 'never kill') or by adjusting our attitudes toward special cases (Superman was wrong to kill Zod).
Justice is fairness. Fair laws can treat people unequally only to the extent that they benefit the worst off in society. Fair laws can be generated by imagining what laws would be in our best interest to adopt, if we were completely ignorant of our individual characteristics (e.g. race, income, sex). For example, from an egocentrically rational perspective, you would not accept a law that could be detrimental to women if you might be a woman. 
Utilitarianism does not protect against unfair discrimination.
