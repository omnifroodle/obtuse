When A and B are identical, what is true of A is true of B and vice versa (Leibniz's Law). If whatever is true of A is true of B, and vice versa, then A is identical with B. (the Identity of Indiscernibles).
Necessary truths are truths by definition: when a truth is necessary, the reason for it can be found by analysis, that is, by resolving it into simpler ideas and truths until the primary ones are reached.
Principle of Sufficient Reason: Everything is the way  that it is, rather than some other way, for a reason.
