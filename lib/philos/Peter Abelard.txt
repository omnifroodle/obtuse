False sentences signify the state of affairs which, if they obtained, would make the sentence true.
Logic is the art of distinguishing between valid and invalid arguments.
Exists can be replaced by a quantifier plus a verb.
There are two ways to predicate possibility: de sensu (now called de dicto) and de re. Consider the proposition, It is possible for the king not to be king. On the de sensu interpretation, the proposition would be: The king is not the king is possibly true. This is false. On the de re reading, the proposition would be: the king may be deposed. This could be true.
