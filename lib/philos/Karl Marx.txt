History evolves in a lawlike fashion.
Capitalism will be replaced by the dictatorship of the proletariat, which will abolish private property, and usher in a socialist state. Capitalism, where business owners do not necessarily work for the businesses they own, will be replaced by worker-owned businesses. Private business will be abolished.
Workers cannot receive a fair return on their work so long as we use money to pay people.
Historical Materialism: the systems we use to produce and exchange goods and services determine the political systems as well as the intellectual history of our society.
Private property is the basis of the State, and the State alienates us from our true nature. Revolution, not philosophical reflection, is the solution to the problem of the State. The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.
