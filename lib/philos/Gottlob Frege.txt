There are three realms: the physical realm, the realm of ideas, and the realm of objective thought.
A sentence can have a sense and a reference. The sense connects the sentence to an intended meaning or mode of presentation (e.g. 'The evening star is over there' is a way of expressing a thought about Venus). The reference connects the sentence to things in the world (e.g. 'The evening star is over there' refers to an object, namely, Venus). We may be unaware that two sentences are describing the same reference, for example, if one of us does not know that Venus is the evening star. We regulated languages have one word per sense.
Sentences in works of fiction can lack reference.
Arithmetic and logic are known a priori, and their truths are all truths by definition.
Logic is not a branch of psychology
